					<div class="p-text">
						Abbey Arts is an independent, non-religious, nonprofit providing creative events at
						unusual spaces around Seattle. This organization aims to create affordable, welcoming and
						inclusive experiences where people can learn and develop through education and
						performance in many different art mediums. Ultimately, Abbey Arts strives to be a
						community-driven,
						volunteer-powered organization, that hosts events that are made of a comfortable
						safe space where a wide variety of people from different income levels, skills, ethnicities,
						backgrounds can interact.<a href='https://www.fremontabbey.org/' target="_blank"> View

						Our information solution will aim to improve website design and seamless
						integrations for the current Abbey Arts website. For website design, we want to focus on
						branding, navigation, interactions, and content. Specifically, we want to conduct thorough
						primary and secondary UI/UX research to ensure that our proposed designs and approach to
						development reflects contemporary trends in how performing arts organizations
						advertise themselves via their websites. In doing so, we can ensure that users have a
						positive experience on Abbey Arts' website that will encourage them to stay on the site
						longer, make purchases, and return to Abbey Arts (both online and in-person) in the
						future.<br><br> For integrations, we want to focus on the G Suite and analytics. By
						providing this solution, users will be able to understand the purpose of information on
						the website and easily comprehend the events and programs possible through Abbey
						Arts, hopefully increasing website traffic and ticket sales as well. The way
						information on the site is presented to potential customers, performers, and facility
						renters
						is crucial to how they initially perceive Abbey Arts, particularly if the site is
						their first encounter they have with the organization.

						As a non-profit, Abbey Arts' limited resources prevent them from pursuing all projects,

						modern, user-friendly, and well-designed website reduces their ability to
						attract more customers and performers. Currently, the outdated website is challenging to
						navigate, has no clear design scheme, and gives a sense of information overload. These
						aspects of website design and function are crucial to maintaining a customer base and
						creating a user-friendly experience. Additionally, the back-end processes are not
						streamlined which causes disconnect in internal business processes. Without a strong
						functioning

						in fulfilling their mission to engage and connect the Seattle community through live
						music and the arts.

									Our <strong>problem statement</strong> stated above clearly defines the problem
									we are trying to solve in a
									way that is specific, measurable, and achievable. It also take into account
									the needs and requirements of the users or stakeholders.<br><br>

									Our <strong>project goal</strong> defines the desired outcome of the project and
									provides a
									clear direction for the rest of the design process. It aligns with the
									problem statement and takes into account the resources, time, and budget
									available.<br><br>

									Our <strong>information problem</strong> has a clear understanding of the
									current state of knowledge
									about the problem and any gaps that need to be filled in order to solve it. It
									includes an analysis of the information needs of the users or stakeholders and
									an
									understanding of the sources and types of information that are
									available.<br><br>

									Overall, the Define stage was critical for setting the foundation for the rest
									of the
									design process and ensuring that the project is aligned with the needs of the
									users
									or stakeholders.<br><br>
								</p>

								<h2 class="mb-1 p-header">RESEARCH</h2>
								<p class="text">

									Our <strong>insight research</strong> uncovered user needs, pain points, and
									behaviors
									for our project.
									It was essential to the initial stages of our project as it provided valuable
									insights
									that informed the design of
									user-centered products and services that needed to be addressed. To conduct this
									research, we held user interviews and usability tests
									throughout the entire design process to ensure that user needs are met.<br><br>

									Our <strong>user research</strong> helped gain insights into users' motivations,
									goals,
									and pain points so that we could make well-informed decisions
									about how to design the product so that it be both usable and enjoyable to use. One
									of
									our biggest learning experiences was attending an Abbey Arts
									event and getting to know our user group. <br><br>

									Our <strong>market research</strong> involved collecting and analyzing other similar
									existing websites, such as Neumos or The Crocadile Venues. The knowledge
									gained from this information was used to better understand the user needs and
									preferences, which further informed the development of the product and service.
									Additionally, it helped identify emerging trends and changes in user behavior, which
									likewise informed marketing and branding strategies.<br><br>

									Our <strong>literature review</strong> involved gathering and analyzing existing
									literature to gain insights into the current state of knowledge, identify gaps
									in the research, and synthesize findings.<br><br>
